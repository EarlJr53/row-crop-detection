# Project Proposal

My goal for this project is to explore methods of detecting crops and choosing a path to navigate between them. From the perspective of a ground robot navigating along rows of crops, I intend to be able to detect adjacent plants and determine which area is driveable.

I plan to find a dataset of images from the POV of a ground-based agriculture robot, which I can then explore in a few ways. First, I plan to use OpenCV to create a basic pipeline to detect obstacles versus the path (either by object detection or image segmentation). I am also interested in finding a more complex pre-made model and experimenting with running my image set through it to see how it behaves.

My learning goals are:
- Understand the differences between the simple and complex CV models I could use
- Experiment with applications of CV in precision agriculture
- Gain experience implementing/using CV in agriculture, potentially to apply to my work in the RoboLab
